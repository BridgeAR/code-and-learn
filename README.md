# Code + Learn

A series of workshop sprints for Node.js.

## Purpose

While we've had a lot of success bringing in new contributors, it remains difficult to get new developers involved in certain areas without greater support than we currently offer. This program will attempt to get new developers involved in those areas through a series of hands-on workshops led by existing contributors. The hands-on workshops lead in to "sprints" where new developers tackle real problems in the code base with the support of the mentors in attendance.

Concerns have also been raising about efforts that might increase the number of developers without broadening the demographics of those developers. Outreach will need to be integrated into the program and the program will also need to be distributed geographically.

## Implementation

*[This is still actively under discussion.](https://github.com/nodejs/code-and-learn/issues/1)*

## Prior Art and Integration

Obviously, NodeSchool is a widely distributed community that is teaching new Node developers. While there's a lot that we can learn from NodeSchool and we will be actively engaged with that community in order to expand the geographic presence of Code + Learn, the goals are slightly different. NodeSchool, by design, doesn't make much of an effort to onboard contributors into the Node.js core project. NodeSchool also relies on building material for use by groups which by definition can't address getting contributors involved in areas of the project which are not very well or widely understood.
